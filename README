Vesp version 0.01
=================

This is a small AnyEvent based webserver. I was a little frustraited
with other solutions, so i came up with my own. Note that this is very
early release, there are a lot of things missing, even essential ones.

I VERY strongly recomend you to use any other solution possible, until
Vesp hits at least version 0.10
